## Code Examples

### JavaScript

```javascript
const greeting = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return { success: true };
};
```

### Go

```go

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### TypeScript

```typescript

## Mixed Content

Combining **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and [links](https://github.com):

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `inline code` for technical terms
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) for reference

## Final Notes

This test file demonstrates all the enhanced markdown rendering features:

1. Six levels of headings with colored backgrounds
2. Full-width code blocks with borders
3. Tables with rounded borders
4. Custom bullets and checkboxes
5. Block quotes with indicators
6. Horizontal rules for section separation

> **Tip**: The background colors follow a rainbow progression from H1 (red) to H6 (purple), making it easy to see the document hierarchy at a glance!
